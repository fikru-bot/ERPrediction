# ER Patient Mortality Prediction and Outcome Analysis

This project analyzes emergency room patient data using Python for data preparation and machine learning, and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## 📊 Highlights

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of emergency room patient records
- Built a machine learning classification model to predict patient mortality based on clinical indicators such as age, wait time, infection rate, and readmission history.
- Correlation analysis and summary statistics to identify key factors affecting patient outcomes
- Visualizations of trends in patient wait times, mortality rates, readmission rates, and department referrals using Power BI
- Insights into feature relationships such as how age, wait time, and infection rates correlate with mortality and recovery outcomes

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
